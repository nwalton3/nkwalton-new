# Learn To Design for Web #
## A Resource Guide for Print Designers #

Web design is to print design as rugby is to american football.

If you've learned one sport you have some of the fundamentals for the other, but the rules, and therefore the strategy, are _completely_ different. If you walk onto a rugby pitch and try to play with a football mindset, _you will lose_.

The same goes for web design: you've got to get in the right mindset.

In that spirit, here are some resources that will help you think like a web designer. I've found that it's kind of difficult to switch frequently, so if you're looking to master web you should invest a good amount of time in a continuous block if you can.

#### The place to start: #

The web publication [_A List Apart_](http://alistapart.com/) (ALA) is the source for the best thinking in web design and development.  

If you only have time to read one article, John Allsop's "[A Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao)" (from ALA) is the best article that's ever been written about the web design mindset.

#### Some of the best articles from _A List Apart_: #

- [The ALA Primer: A Guide for New Readers](http://alistapart.com/article/ALAprimer) (2008)
- [ALA Summer Reading Issue](http://alistapart.com/article/summer-reading-issue) (2012)
